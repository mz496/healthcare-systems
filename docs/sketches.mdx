Healthcare is a system for strangers to take care of each other.

## What even is healthcare

This is you, the Patient. Your body is a very complex, very important machine.

But healthcare can be simple. Let's take the simplest possible case. It's just you and a Provider. We will keep money and modern medicine in the equation because those are pretty unequivocally useful concepts.

Let's say the Provider is magical and has infinite knowledge (of all fields of medicine, your medical history, and your lifestyle) and time (to dedicate to think about you, think about advances in the field and what that means for you, etc). Because of this, you trust them infinitely with your life.

Roughly, there is proactive care (when you think nothing is going wrong) and reactive care (when you think something looks wrong).

Proactive care looks like:
- You go to see the Provider.
- Your Provider uses their infinite knowledge and care to understand what people of your age range, ethnicity, or what-have-you should do. They might run some tests or recommend some drug, or they could just say everything is fine.
- The Provider collects money from you in exchange for their labor + any goods they dispense you.

Reactive care looks like:
- You go to see a Provider because your xyz hurts.
- They run some tests and operations and recommend a course of action, possibly across multiple visits.
- The Provider collects money from you in exchange for their labor + any goods they dispense you.

And importantly, 
- Everyone is happy with this exchange.
