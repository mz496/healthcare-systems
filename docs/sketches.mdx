Not super organized, but a bit more organized than scribbles.

Healthcare is a system for strangers to take care of each other.

This aims to be a snapshot of how the US healthcare system works in 2026.

We'll start with a simple idealized model of healthcare and build up the implications one by one to put the many layers of the system into perspective.




## Care is between a Patient and a Provider

This is you, the Patient. Your body is a very complex, very important machine.

But healthcare can be simple. Let's take the simplest possible case. We will keep trade and modern medicine in the equation because those are pretty widely accepted as useful concepts, i.e. there will be no "I barter my way through the neighborhood in search of a doctor who will help me in exchange for a chain of favors" or "I manufacture my own remedy from raw ingredients" here.

It's just you and a Provider. Let's say the Provider is magical and has infinite knowledge (of all fields of medicine, all relevant technologies, your medical history, and your lifestyle) and time (to dedicate to think about you, think about advances in the field and what that means for you, etc). Because of this, you trust them infinitely with your life.

There is proactive care (when you think nothing is going wrong) and reactive care (when you think something looks wrong). Both are roughly the same:

- You go to see the Provider.
- Your Provider uses their infinite knowledge and care to understand what you should do today and going forward in order to optimize your overall well-being as a person of your age, sex assigned at birth, or what-have-you, plus possibly any conditions you observe. They might run some tests, recommend some drug, schedule follow-up visits later, or just say everything is fine.
- The Provider collects money from you at a fair price in exchange for their service and any goods they dispense you, which, because of their infinite knowledge, is correct. Everyone is happy!

Everything else on top comes from the many real-world realities that we have to patch in a way that balances out everyone's incentives.





## Types of providers

It's not very feasible for one person to be an expert at everything. They are much more likely to be wrong when asked a question they've spent four years studying in bits and pieces versus one they've spent six additional years studying in great detail. We distinguish between generalists and specialists both in theory (how medical school and certifications are structured) and in practice (bestowing specialized roles and titles on them once they finish).

So when we say Provider, that could be one of these professional categories:
- Primary Care Physician (generalist)
- Specialist
- Doctors

Logistically, it's not feasible for one person to do everything, either. Supporting staff are easy to overlook but still directly help with smaller care-related tasks like taking vitals, triaging, or assisting with procedures when doctors are doing other higher-level tasks: nurses, medical assistants, technicians.

However, they all roll up to the accountable PCP/specialist/doctor, so we will exclude them for now.

TODO: diagram

- TODO: Sidebar for later: That's different from access control, which roughly aims to put cost on the decision-maker for which conversations are most useful (i.e. restricting specialists behind PCPs or being able to see specialists directly for a higher cost; HMO/EPO/PPO insurance plans differ significantly on this front).





## Where medicine comes from

The Provider needs to get medications from a pharmaceutical company that put in the work to test and mass-produce them, which we will call the Drug Manufacturer.

## Who is paying

So far, we have only walked through what care looks like. But who is paying?

If we ideologically think it's right to value life and health and are willing to take on the human time and energy costs (some would say as a direct implication of the Declaration of Independence), how much financial responsibility does each party take?

In the US, we have a mix of private and public programs, often supplementing the Patient's responsibility.
- TODO: Link out to sidebar on brief history of US employer-sponsored healthcare starting from 1942 wage controls.
- TODO: Link out to "should employers be the ones paying?"
- TODO: Sidebar on "should providers be involved with money?"
- TODO: Single-payer around the world; its advantages and disadvantages.

Breakdown of the ~340m Americans in 2024 ([US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2025/demo/p60-288.html)) (TODO: diagram this like a pie chart):
- 92%: insured (note that this adds up to more than 92% due to overlaps)
    - 53.8% (~181m people): employer-sponsored insurance
    - 19.1%: Medicare (original Medicare + Medicare Advantage; Clover, Devoted, Bright, Humana)
    - 17.6%: Medicaid (original Medicaid + Medicaid Managed Care; Centene/Ambetter, Molina, UHC)
    - 10.7%: direct-purchase coverage (ACA exchange + off-exchange individual; Oscar, Bright, Ambetter, Molina)
    - 2.8%: TRICARE (government-sponsored military)
    - 1.2%: VA, CHAMPVA (veterans)
- 8%: uninsured

From now on, we will focus on the employer-sponsored insurance segment, meaning the Payer is equivalent to the Insurance and is not, say, the government or the Patient themselves.









## (Employer-sponsored) insurance

We have two new parties: the Employer and the Insurer.

In proactive care, a preventative visit can cost as little as $100, and in reactive care, a heart transplant could cost up to $1 million. Certain events are much less predictable than others and rightly get very different treatment.

Insurance, i.e. the Patient's employer, takes on most of these costs. In the US, this is often synonymous with healthcare, but it's only one part. Ultimately, this is about risk pooling: which pool do you pay money to when you are healthy so that you can withdraw from it for care, both proactive and reactive?

TODO: primer on initial models of indemnity.

Today though, this is where most people's negative interactions begin:
- Patient gets (or tries to get) care
- Provider checks with, or bounces them to, Insurer to make sure the Provider will get paid
- Possible black hole of inefficient communications due to one or more of:
  - the Patient may not know what they are paying
  - the Provider can set whatever price they want
  - the Insurer can refuse it or require lots of extra documentation before paying (suspecting that certain procedures are not necessary, for example)
- End state is that Insurer and Patient potentially both cover some of the cost to be sent to the Provider and other parties involved. We will get to those other parties. For now, we will settle with the fact that for an individual transaction, money flows out from Patient + Insurer.

Asides:
- TODO: Sidebar on: Insurance works a little differently in healthcare if we define it as "providing protection against a possible eventuality" since we also use it for proactive care. Should the government fund proactive care? Should insurance only be for reactive care? Probably yes and yes; study other countries like Singapore. But we are not there yet.
- TODO: Link out to "should employers be the ones we create risk pools around?" Probably yes, they are the most convenient natural grouping we have. See [Yuzu ICHRA post](https://yuzu.health/blog/a-clear-explanation-of-ichras)
- TODO: what happens to small employers \<50, they are forced into small-group where they get risk-pooled with other small employers?

Breakdown of the employer-funded market ([KFF, 2025](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/2025-employer-health-benefits-survey/#7ba66406-39e9-4413-bb1e-e4dda7a46a20)) (TODO: diagram in something like a pie chart):
- Self-funded (67%, 120m people):
    - Level-funded (All Savers, Gravie, Sana Benefits, Poppins Health)
    - Traditional self-insurance as TPAs (Meritain, UHC, Cigna)
- Fully-insured (33%, 60m people) (UHC, Cigna, Aetna, Oscar, many others):
    - Small group (\<50 employees)
    - Large group (50+ employees)

TODO: diagram/link out to all of the players in the self-funded space (employer has to interface with brokers; TPA has to interface with MGUs etc) in the style of https://yuzu.health/blog/parts-of-a-health-plan

### Insurance "products"

TODO: expand on each of these, link out and create diagrams
- FSA (1970s-)
- HSA with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) (2003-): pushes market decisions onto the patient.
- ICHRA (2020-): an individual-market health plan administered by an employer






## Running the drug delivery process

There are so many drugs and so many clinics around the country that distributing those to where they need to go is a huge task.

TODO: Pharmacists and PBMs (Pharmacy Benefits Managers)

- Sidebar: PBMs are quite concentrated, with the top four holding 67% of market share in 2023 ([AMA source](https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/access-care/these-4-big-names-are-largest-pbms-us)).
- PBMs usually make money off rebates that they can get unbeknownst to the health plan. [Yuzu source](https://yuzu.health/blog/why-your-meds-cost-so-much)
- Yuzu works with SmithRx since they are transparent in their pricing and take a per-script fee while sharing all their rebates back with the plan, eliminating conflict of interest. [Yuzu source](https://yuzu.health/blog/parts-of-a-health-plan)





## Administration of the clinics/hospitals/practices

Who is keeping the lights on at the provider's place of work, making sure they're getting paid, and making sure they have all the hospital beds/stethoscopes/hand soaps/etc. they need in order to do their jobs?

TODO:
- Admin at the Provider's place of work are often-maligned folk who keep things running.
- Just because they are not directly caring for patients does not mean that they are unnecessary.


## So where is the problem?

TODO expand greatly

Much of the industry is mired in "the system is bad, but at least I've got my profit so I'm okay with that."

We can and should strive for better:

- **Price opacity.** This usually falls somewhere between the Provider/Admin/Insurer (cost of services, untrusted coding leading to dumb prior auth "gaming"/arms races, etc) but also sneaks into places like the PBMs.

Our north star ought to be reducing these problems at all times, starting as far upstream as possible.
