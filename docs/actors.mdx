# Actors in the US healthcare system

Healthcare is a system for strangers to take care of each other.

We'll start with a simple idealized model of healthcare and build up the implications in increasing levels of complexity to put the many layers of the system into perspective.

We will need to ground ourselves in baseline ideas that are widely accepted as true:
- Trade, money, and private enterprise are good for transmitting trust and fostering innovation. There will be no "I barter my way through the neighborhood in search of a doctor who will help me in exchange for a chain of favors" here.
- Treatment based on scientific evidence and technological advances is useful. Certainly, "modern"/conventional/allopathic medicine has its strengths and weaknesses when compared to natural and holistic remedies, which have their own strengths and weaknesses, but there will be no "I manufacture my own remedy from raw ingredients" here.

Other stances:
- For the purposes of this research, I am not intrinsically motivated by the history of healthcare or its industry, only insofar as it helps us decide where to go next. So I am intentionally light on historical details.
- I am just a random tech person who doesn't work in healthcare, is generally optimistic about technology, business, and human progress, but is generally skeptical about most businesses' long-term impacts. I built this as part of my research into the healthcare space while interviewing at a few healthcare startups in 2025, and I do not profit by taking any particular stance.




## Care is between a Patient and a Provider

Your body is a very complex, very important machine, but healthcare can be simple. Just take a look at the Hippocratic Oath.

Let's take the simplest possible case with just you and a Provider. Let's say the Provider is magical and has infinite knowledge (of all fields of medicine, all relevant technologies, your medical history, and your lifestyle) and time (to dedicate to think about you, think about advances in the field and what that means for you, etc). Because of this, you trust them infinitely with your life.

There is proactive care (when you think nothing is going wrong) and reactive care (when you think something looks wrong). Both are roughly the same:

- You and the Provider meet.
- Your Provider uses their infinite knowledge and care to understand what you should do today and going forward in order to optimize your overall well-being as a person of your age, sex assigned at birth, or other traits, plus possibly any conditions you observe. They might do any combination of things, including but not limited to: operating on you, running tests, recommending some drug or other course of action, scheduling follow-up visits later, or saying everything is fine.
- The Provider collects money from you at a fair price in exchange for their service and any goods they dispense you, which, because of their infinite knowledge, is correct. Everyone is happy!

Everything else on top comes from the real-world realities of both imperfections in how things actually play out and also having to scale this to many, many people. Let's add in some other basic truths that are unavoidable in this modern framework:

- Humans have lots of parts that have layers of complexity to them. What happens when one person cannot know or do everything? (Types of providers)
- Where is the research, development, and production of treatments and drugs happening? (Where pharmaceutical products come from)
- Given that we have multiple people, products, and pieces of complex equipment, how do we make sure they're accessible at a single point-of-care? (Physical infrastructure)
- How do we get people to want to do this work? (Who is paying)





## Types of providers

What happens when one person cannot know or do everything?

Someone is more likely to be wrong when asked a question they've spent four years studying in bits and pieces versus one they've spent six additional years studying in great detail. Some jobs are less mentally and physically taxing and are effective training mechanisms for those less experienced. A single person is also physically limited in where they can put their time and attention on the job. (TODO surgeon 24-hour shifts).

For simplicity, we will consider a single primarily accountable person as the Provider, with caveats that there are many supporting staff. Click into this TODO link to understand incentives within this space.
- Fan-out from generalist to specialists, a common pattern both entrenched in schooling and necessity:
    - Primary Care Physician fans out into Specialists and others
    - Attending Physician fans out into Consulting Physicians and others
    - Attending Surgeon fans out into Assisting Surgeons, Specialists, and others
- Many other supporting staff directly help with care-related tasks like taking vitals, triaging, or assisting with procedures when doctors are doing other higher-level tasks: nurses, medical assistants, equipment technicians, lab technicians, etc.
- TODO: Sending samples for analysis elsewhere involves other specialties like medical laboratory scientist/medical laboratory technologist.
- TODO: probably more.

TODO: diagram

- TODO: people do actually want to have a team led by a physician; see sources here: https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/scope-practice/physician-led-team-based-care#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20physician%2Dled%20team,Guiding%20principles%20for%20physician%20leaders
- TODO: Link to Russell's post on shadowing a healthcare worker
- TODO: Sidebar for later: This is different from access control, which roughly aims to put cost on the decision-maker for which conversations are most useful (i.e. restricting specialists behind PCPs or being able to see specialists directly for a higher cost; HMO/EPO/PPO insurance plans differ significantly on this front).
- TODO: Sidebar for later: lots of people are just more cautious vs less cautious at the doctor, but PCPs are usually pretty trigger-happy when it comes to referrals. What does this do to the incentives






## Where pharmaceutical products come from

Where is the research, development, and production of treatments and drugs happening?

The Provider needs to get products from a Pharmaceutical Company that put in the work to test and mass-produce them. These generally include drugs (oral, topical, etc.) and devices ()

For simplicity of our diagram, we will add the minimal piece required: the flow of products from the Pharmaceutical Company to the Patient. Click on this TODO link to understand incentives within this space.
- TODO: internal complexity: flow diagram like the one in https://yuzu.health/blog/why-your-meds-cost-so-much. See https://schaeffer.usc.edu/research/flow-of-money-through-the-pharmaceutical-distribution-system/ and verify claim: "Of a $100 expenditure on pharmaceuticals by consumers, roughly $17 goes to drug production costs, $41 accrues to the manufacturers (a third of which is net profit), and $19 accrues to insurers. PBMs keep about $5, pharmacies keep $15, and wholesalers keep about $2"

Other TODO:

- Sidebar: PBMs are quite concentrated, with the top four holding 67% of market share in 2023 ([AMA source](https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/access-care/these-4-big-names-are-largest-pbms-us)).
- PBMs usually make money off rebates that they can get unbeknownst to the health plan. [Yuzu source](https://yuzu.health/blog/why-your-meds-cost-so-much)
- Yuzu works with SmithRx since they are transparent in their pricing and take a per-script fee while sharing all their rebates back with the plan, eliminating conflict of interest. [Yuzu source](https://yuzu.health/blog/parts-of-a-health-plan)






## Physical infrastructure

Given that we have multiple people, products, and pieces of complex equipment, how do we make sure they're accessible at a single point-of-care?

Physical house calls were common in the 19th and 20th century; they have been mostly replaced by patients going to a centralized place except in cases such as elderly care. [TODO: find a better source](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/changes-medicine-during-19th-century). 

This helps with scale: on the physical side, someone can buy equipment in aggregate and store it all in one place, and doctors can collaborate with one another directly.

## Who is paying

How do we get people to want to do this work?

It takes a lot of time and money to train and maintain Providers' skills, develop pharmaceutical products, and keep the lights on at points-of-care. And even when everything goes right, everyone is acting perfectly in good faith, with everyone invested in a dense-ish network of trust (minus operating on someone a doctor directly knows, for example), it is still hard to make tradeoffs in the moment on what is worth doing vs. not.

So after removing some idealism and adding some practicality: if we believe it's right to value life and health and are willing to take on the human time and energy costs, how much financial responsibility does each party take?

In the US, we have a mix of private and public programs, often supplementing the Patient's responsibility.
- TODO: Link out to sidebar on brief history of US employer-sponsored healthcare starting from 1942 wage controls.
- TODO: Link out to "should employers be the ones paying?"
- TODO: Sidebar on "should providers be involved with money?"
- TODO: Single-payer around the world; its advantages and disadvantages.

Breakdown of the ~340m Americans in 2024 ([US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2025/demo/p60-288.html)) (TODO: diagram this like a pie chart):
- 92%: insured (note that this adds up to more than 92% due to overlaps)
    - 53.8% (~181m people): employer-sponsored insurance
    - 19.1%: Medicare (original Medicare + Medicare Advantage; Clover, Devoted, Bright, Humana)
    - 17.6%: Medicaid (original Medicaid + Medicaid Managed Care; Centene/Ambetter, Molina, UHC)
    - 10.7%: direct-purchase coverage (ACA exchange + off-exchange individual; Oscar, Bright, Ambetter, Molina)
    - 2.8%: TRICARE (government-sponsored military)
    - 1.2%: VA, CHAMPVA (veterans)
- 8%: uninsured

For purposes of this writeup, we will focus on the employer-sponsored insurance segment, meaning the Payer is equivalent to the Insurance and is not, say, the government or the Patient themselves. Click this TODO link to dig deeper into incentives.











## So where is the problem?

TODO expand greatly

Much of the industry is mired in "the system is bad, but at least I've got my profit so I'm okay with that."

We can and should strive for better:

- **Price opacity.** This usually falls somewhere between the Provider/Admin/Insurer (cost of services, untrusted coding leading to dumb prior auth "gaming"/arms races, etc) but also sneaks into places like the PBMs.

Our north star ought to be reducing these problems at all times, starting as far upstream as possible.
