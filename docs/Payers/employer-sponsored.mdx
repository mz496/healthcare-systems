# (Employer-sponsored) insurance

We have two new parties: the Employer and the Insurer.

In proactive care, a preventative visit can cost as little as $100, and in reactive care, a heart transplant could cost up to $1 million. Certain events are much less predictable than others and rightly get very different treatment.

Insurance, i.e. the Patient's employer, takes on most of these costs. In the US, this is often synonymous with healthcare, but it's only one part. Ultimately, this is about risk pooling: which pool do you pay money to when you are healthy so that you can withdraw from it for care, both proactive and reactive?

TODO: primer on initial models of indemnity.

Today though, this is where most people's negative interactions begin:
- Patient gets (or tries to get) care
- Provider checks with, or bounces them to, Insurer to make sure the Provider will get paid
- Possible black hole of inefficient communications due to one or more of:
  - the Patient may not know what they are paying
  - the Provider can set whatever price they want
  - the Insurer can refuse it or require lots of extra documentation before paying (suspecting that certain procedures are not necessary, for example)
- End state is that Insurer and Patient potentially both cover some of the cost to be sent to the Provider and other parties involved. We will get to those other parties. For now, we will settle with the fact that for an individual transaction, money flows out from Patient + Insurer.

Asides:
- TODO: Sidebar on: Insurance works a little differently in healthcare if we define it as "providing protection against a possible eventuality" since we also use it for proactive care. Should the government fund proactive care? Should insurance only be for reactive care? Probably yes and yes; study other countries like Singapore. But we are not there yet.
- TODO: Link out to "should employers be the ones we create risk pools around?" Probably yes, they are the most convenient natural grouping we have. See [Yuzu ICHRA post](https://yuzu.health/blog/a-clear-explanation-of-ichras)
- TODO: what happens to small employers \<50, they are forced into small-group where they get risk-pooled with other small employers?

Breakdown of the employer-funded market ([KFF, 2025](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/2025-employer-health-benefits-survey/#7ba66406-39e9-4413-bb1e-e4dda7a46a20)) (TODO: diagram in something like a pie chart):
- Self-funded (67%, 120m people):
    - Level-funded (All Savers, Gravie, Sana Benefits, Poppins Health)
    - Traditional self-insurance as TPAs (Meritain, UHC, Cigna)
- Fully-insured (33%, 60m people) (UHC, Cigna, Aetna, Oscar, many others):
    - Small group (\<50 employees)
    - Large group (50+ employees)

TODO: diagram/link out to all of the players in the self-funded space (employer has to interface with brokers; TPA has to interface with MGUs etc) in the style of https://yuzu.health/blog/parts-of-a-health-plan

### Insurance "products"

TODO: expand on each of these, link out and create diagrams
- FSA (1970s-)
- HSA with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) (2003-): pushes market decisions onto the patient.
- ICHRA (2020-): an individual-market health plan administered by an employer
