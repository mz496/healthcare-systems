# Getting Started

Welcome to the Healthcare documentation site! This page demonstrates how you can embed interactive React components directly into your documentation.

## Interactive Counter Component

Below is a fully functional React component with state management. Click the buttons to see it in action!

<Counter />

## How It Works

This counter uses React's `useState` hook to manage the count value. The component is imported from a separate file (`src/components/Counter.tsx`) and can be reused across multiple pages.

You can create any React component you want and embed it in your docs this way!
