# Examples

## Interactive Counter

Here is a stateful React component:

<Counter />

## Footnotes

This section demonstrates how to use footnotes with custom React components.

### How Footnotes Work

Footnotes allow you to cite sources or add additional context without cluttering the main text. Here's an example with custom labels and slugs:

The healthcare industry in the United States is valued at over $4 trillion annually<FootnoteRef slug="cms-data" label="source1" />. Many countries are working to improve universal healthcare coverage<FootnoteRef slug="who-report" label="WHO2023" />, while others focus on reducing costs through preventive care<FootnoteRef slug="cdc-preventive" label="cdc-report" />.

You can also reference the same footnote multiple times. For instance, the WHO report<FootnoteRef slug="who-report" label="WHO2023" /> mentions this again.

### Multiple References

Some facts require multiple sources. The average life expectancy has increased globally<FootnoteRef slug="cms-data" label="source1" /><FootnoteRef slug="who-report" label="WHO2023" /> over the past century.

### References

<FootnoteList>
  <Footnote slug="cms-data" label="source1">
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. "National Health Expenditure Data." 2024.
  </Footnote>
  <Footnote slug="who-report" label="WHO2023">
    World Health Organization. "Universal Health Coverage Report 2023." WHO Publications.
  </Footnote>
  <Footnote slug="cdc-preventive" label="cdc-report">
    CDC. "Preventive Care and Cost Reduction Study." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2024.
  </Footnote>
</FootnoteList>

---

### Usage

**Inline reference:**
```jsx
<FootnoteRef slug="who-report" label="WHO2023" />
```

**Footnote definition:**
```jsx
<Footnote slug="who-report" label="WHO2023">
  World Health Organization. "Universal Health Coverage Report 2023."
</Footnote>
```

**Props:**
- `slug`: Internal identifier for linking (e.g., "who-report") - use this to connect refs to footnotes
- `label`: Visible text shown to user (e.g., "WHO2023")

**Features:**
- Click the label to jump to the footnote
- Click the ↩ arrow to jump back to where you were reading
- Reuse the same footnote multiple times by using the same `slug`
- Decouple visible labels from internal references
